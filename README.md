Web Scraping with R
===================

-----------
[Hacker News](hackernews) [WIP]

Scraping the title of the post, external website, user, points/upvotes, time it was posted, and number of comments in an attempt to see if there are any keywords or external website that makes a post get more upvotes.

-----------
[Investor Hub](investorhub) [WIP]

I wanted to test my knowledge of R as well as learn more by scraping stock data again.  Originally I scraped from [tiingo.com](https://tiingo.com) using Python, but this time I scraped from [investorshub.com](https://investorshub.advfn.com).  The headlines on this website could be used more so for a script to help one invest.  I decided to upload this anyway.

------
[Finviz](finviz) [WIP]

I thought about scraping this website at one point but am now.  There is a lot of data that is easily accessible.  In this project I am going to scrape the stock numerical information and try and predict stock prices, as well as use the stock headlines in an NLP project to perform sentiment analysis.
